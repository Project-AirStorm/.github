## Objective and Problem Statement
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models have long been used for weather forecasts, but they require significant time, expertise, and costly computing resources for accurate predictions. To remain competitive, the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) must leverage emerging technologies. The objective is to implement a generative AI weather forecasting model, **GraphCast**, to enhance AFGSC's capabilities, aiming for:

- **30%** improvement in weather forecast accuracy
- **20%** reduction in mission planning and response time
- **Over 80%** adoption rate among AFGSC personnel

## Key Features
- **Real-time Data Processing:** Predict accurate weather conditions every six hours for a ten-day forecast.
- **Critical Weather Forecasting Alerts:** Forecast severe weather events like thunderstorms, turbulence, and icing.
- **Sophisticated UI:** Present complex weather data in an easy-to-understand interface.
